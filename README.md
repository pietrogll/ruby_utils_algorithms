# ruby_utils_algorithms

This collection of documents is a mix of study material and notes that I have been compiling so that I can get back to them when necessary. They are that kind of things that I use to study, understand and then leave aside till the moment I need to apply them.

The purpose of this repo it to have a place where to go to look for cool things I now I new ;)
